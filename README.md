# Pareto-Frontier-Project
The project focuses on applying, creating, and testing different execution methods across different cryptoasset markets and exchanges to come up with a modular approach to executing orders across various exchanges and order types with the objective of reducing transaction costs across markets, trading resolutions (frequency), and capital amounts.
Specifically, we utilize Almgren and Chriss model for optimal execution of portfolio transactions by producing three input estimates: volatility, expected return and market impact and verify the model's superior performance compared to the benchmark models. More information about this model can be found here: https://github.com/viai957/Optimal-Portfolio-Transactions/blob/master/Almgren%20and%20Chriss%20Model.ipynb
